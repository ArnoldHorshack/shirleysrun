<h2>Sad News About Happy Girl</h2>
<p>Sad news.  Yesterday (6/26/2023), Happy Girl who turned 18 in March (2023), crossed the "Rainbow Bridge."  Her dementia got really bad.  She went peacefully.,</p>
<p>I will miss her.  She was a great companion.

I thank Mom for guilting me into taking her in after the Katrina Hurricane.<p>

<h3>2024 Donations</h3>
<h3>Francisvale Home for Smaller Animals </h3>
<p>&quot;On behalf of Francisvale Home for Smaller Animals, we&#39;d like to thank The Shirley Shriftman Fund for Animals DAF, administered by The Montgomery County Foundation, Inc. for generously supporting our organization and our mission.  Your gift ensures that the very special cats and dogs in our care will continue to receive the highest-level care while they wait to be adopted into their forever homes.  At Francisvale, we add a personal touch to the day-to-day care for our pets that both enriches their lives and allows them to showcase their best selves to prospective adopters.  Pets like Gage, a five-year-old mixed breed, can live care-free, while we focus on finding him a home.  In addition, a kennel space is open at the municipal shelter from where he came so that another pet in need can be rescued.  We are so grateful for your
contribution to that effort!&quot; </p>

<p>  <strong>Milo</strong>, shown above, came from ACCT Philly in Sep. 2023.  He is a lively and friendly boy, but could be overwhelmed by the fast paced environment of a busy shelter like ACCT.  Milo thrived in our care at Francisvale and was adopted on January 23, 2024.</p>

                            Shirley Schriftman was born in Springfield, MA in 1925. From an early age she had
                            a great love of animals. Her favorite childhood book was Mr. Jolly’s Hotel for Dogs.
                            She decided that when she grew up she would rescue animals. During her long life
                            she had many dogs and several cats that were her companions.
                        </p>

                            Shirley lived on Dillon Road in Maple Glen, PA and died peacefully at her home on
